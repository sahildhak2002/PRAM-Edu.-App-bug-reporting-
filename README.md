Test Case Description for PRAM Edu. Website UI Issues
This test case aims to verify the functionality and usability of two major sections of the PRAM Edu. website:

# "Designed For" section under the Discover navigation tab:

The section is visually scrolling with various user categories such as Job Seeker, Student, etc.

However, clicking on any of these categories does not show any relevant information or content, which impacts user experience and functionality.

Additionally, there are three vertical dots (...) at the bottom right corner of this section that appear interactive but do not serve any functional purpose. This could confuse users and should be removed if not in use.

# "Advertisement & Offer" section under the Home navigation tab:

This section displays scrolling advertisements or offers.

The issue is that these offers are not clickable or do not redirect users to any additional information or offer page, rendering the section non-functional.

The test case will check whether these elements are interactive and functional. It will also assess if non-functional UI components like the "three dots" should be retained or removed for cleaner UX.
